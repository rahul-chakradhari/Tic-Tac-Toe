Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players (O and X) to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game detects the winner or a draw, and provides a reset option to play again.

Features
*Two players: Player O and Player X take turns.
*The game detects if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
*Once the game is over (either a player wins or it's a draw), no more moves can be made.
*A reset button allows restarting the game at any time.
*A "Congratulations" message is displayed when a player wins, or "It's a draw" if there is no winner.

How to Play
*Objective: Get three of your marks (either O or X) in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
*Turns: Player O goes first, followed by Player X.
*Winning the Game: The first player to align three marks in a row wins.
*Draw: If all the boxes are filled and no one has won, the game is declared a draw.
*Reset: Click the "Reset" button to restart the game.

Game Rules
*Player O always goes first.
*Players take turns placing their mark (O or X) in an empty box.
*The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
*If all nine boxes are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
*A reset button allows the game to be restarted at any time.

Technologies Used
